### Project motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was proposed by Udacity as a capstone project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. The data is provided by Arvato Financial Services and they contain demographic information of the general population of Germany and their customer base. The goals proposed are:

1) Identify and compare clusters of people from the general population that match the customer base using Unsupervised Learning.

2) Predict who has a high probability of becoming a customer using Supervised Machine Learning.

Files are not available due their size and their sensitivity, but a description of them is provided below.
